This license is protected as a different work, and cannot be used without OpenSend's permission.

## Introduction
OpenSend believes that open source is amazing, like seriously, it's in our name! To protect ourselves, our work, and our projects, we need to restrict how much you can do with our software. While we believe that we should be open, we also believe that our code is ours, and shouldn't just be stolen and re-uploaded. This is why we created this license.

## Conditions
OpenSend has placed the following restrictions on works that this is protected by:
- You are free to redistribute free parts of the software, as long as you do not gain in any way from doing so (you can't sell our software).
- If you do give the software to someone else, they should keep the exact same rights this license grants them.
- You may not outright steal, or plagiarise the source code of this software. (This means you're not able to take a substantial part of it.)
- Any time you do use pieces of code from our software, you must provide credit where credit is due.
- You may not use any trademarks, tradenames, or other marks, owned by OpenSend Technologies without express permission.
- You may not use the names of the software's contributors, backers, developers, sponsors, partners, vendors, or hosters, without express permission.

## Revocation
OpenSend may revoke or void your access to the software at any time. In the event of revocation, you must assume a "no copyright notice" state under the DMCA, which usually prevents any usage or distribution of the software.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR
